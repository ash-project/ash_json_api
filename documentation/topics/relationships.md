# Relationships

You can specify which arguments will modify relationships using `relationship_arguments`, but there are some things to keep in mind.

`relationship_arguments` is a list of arguments that can be edited in the `data.relationships` input.

This is primarily useful for those who want to keep their relationship changes in compliance with the `JSON:API` spec.
If you are not focused on building a fully compliant JSON:API, it is likely far simpler to simply accept arguments
in the `attributes` key and ignore the `data.relationships` input.

If the argument's type is `{:array, _}`, a list of data will be expected. Otherwise, it will expect a single item.

Everything in this guide applies to routs defined on the domain as well.

For example:

```elixir
# On a tweets resource

# With a patch route that references the `authors` argument
json_api do
  routes do
    patch :update, relationship_arguments: [:authors]
  end
end

# And an argument by that name in the action
actions do
  update :update do
    argument :authors, {:array, :map}, allow_nil?: false

    change manage_relationship(:authors, type: :append_and_remove) # Use the authors argument to allow changing the related authors on update
  end
end
```

You can then send the value for `authors` in the relationships key, e.g

```json
{
  data: {
    attributes: {
      ...
    },
    relationships: {
      authors: {
        data: [
          {type: "author", id: 1}, // the `type` key is removed when the value is placed into the action, so this input would be `%{"id" => 1}` (`type` is required by `JSON:API` specification)
          {type: "author", id: 2, meta: {arbitrary: 1, keys: 2}}, <- `meta` is JSON:API spec freeform data, so this input would be `%{"id" => 2, "arbitrary" => 1, "keys" => 2}`
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you do not include `:authors` in the `relationship_arguments` key, you would supply its value in `attributes`, e.g:

```elixir
{
  data: {
    attributes: {
      authors: {
        {id: 1},
        {id: 2, arbitrary: 1, keys: 2},
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Non-map argument types, e.g `argument :author, :integer` (expecting an author id) work with `manage_relationship`, but not with
JSON:API, because it expects `{"type": _type, "id" => id}` for relationship values. To support non-map arguments in `relationship_arguments`,
instead of `:author`, use `{:id, :author}`. This works for `{:array, _}` type arguments as well, so the value would be a list of ids.


## Creating related resources without the id

This feature is useful for creating relationships without requiring two separate API calls and without needing to associate resources with an ID first. This is an escape hatch from the standard approach and is not JSON:API spec compliant, but it is completely possible to implement.

```elixir
# With a post route that references the `leads` argument, this will mean that
# locations will have the ability to create Lead resources when called from 
# the API
  json_api do
    routes do
      base_route "/location", Marketplace.Location do
        post :create, relationship_arguments: [:leads]
      end

      base_route "/lead", Marketplace.Lead do
        post :create
      end
    end
  end


# In the leads resource you will have the following:
  actions do
    create :create do
      primary?(true)
      accept([:type, :description, :priority, :location_id])
    end
  end

  relationships do
    belongs_to :location, Marketplace.Location
  end

# In the Location resource you will have the following:

  actions do
    create :create do
      primary?(true)
      accept([:name, :location, :images])
      argument(:leads, {:array, :map}, allow_nil?: false)

      change(manage_relationship(:leads, type: :create))
    end
  end


  relationships do
    has_many :leads, Marketplace.Lead
  end
```

This way, when requesting to create a location, leads will be automatically created as well.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "location",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Test Location",
      "location": {
        "lat": 32323,
        "long": 23232,
        "address": "test street 123"
      },
      "images": ["url1", "url2", "url3"]
    },
    "relationships": {
      "leads": {
        "data": [
          {
            "type": "lead",
            "meta": {
              "type": "Roof",
              "description": "roofing has 3 holes to fix",
              "priority": "high"
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "lead",
            "meta": {
              "type": "garden",
              "description": "Garden looks like it could be polished",
              "priority": "medium"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the related data won't be returned unless included with the include query parameter. For the JSON:API specification on the include parameter, see [json api fetching includes](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes).

## Relationship Manipulation Routes

You can also specify routes that are dedicated to manipulating relationships. We generally suggest the above approach, but JSON:API spec also allows for dedicated relationship routes. For example:

```elixir
routes do
  ...
  # use `post_to_relationship` when the operation is additive
  post_to_relationship :add_author, action: :add_author
  # use `patch_relationship` when the operation is both additive and subtractive
  # use `delete_from_relationship` when the operation is subtractive
end
```

This will use an action on the source resource, (by default the primary update), and expects it to take an argument with the corresponding name. Additionally, it must have a `change manage_relationship` that uses that attribute. For example:

```elixir
update :add_author do
  argument :author, :map

  change manage_relationship(:author, type: :append)
end
```
