* don't show exceptions if `show_raised_errors?` is `false`

* don't expose `action.name` over api docs

* resource comes from the route on domains

* add missing fields from `InvalidField`

* validate relationships from routes at compile time

### Improvements:

* support `name` on `routes`, use in description and operationId

* verify includes list at compile time

* allow setting a `resource` second option on domain's `base_route` entity

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/ash-project/ash_json_api/compare/v1.1.2...v1.2.0) (2024-06-11)

### Features:

- [AshJsonApi.Domain] add `base_route` constructor to domain router

### Bug Fixes:

- [AshJsonApi.Resource] properly reflect that `default: false` makes a non required attribute

- [AshJsonApi.Resource] non-public attributes can be accepted and required in 3.0

- [AshJsonApi.Resource] support `require_attributes` in json schema

- [AshJsonApi.Resource] ensure that resource-level default_fields are honored

### Improvements:

- [attributes] non-public attributes can be accepted in 3.0

## [v1.1.2](https://github.com/ash-project/ash_json_api/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2) (2024-06-05)

### Bug Fixes:

- [includes] ensure we don't drop includes (as a result of deduplicating them)

## [v1.1.1](https://github.com/ash-project/ash_json_api/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) (2024-06-05)

### Bug Fixes:

- [includes] deduplicate includes list while building it

### Improvements:

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/ash-project/ash_json_api/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) (2024-05-24)

### Features:

- [AshJsonApi.Domain] support routes defined on the domain

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/ash-project/ash_json_api/compare/v1.0.0...v0.34.2)

This changelog has been restarted. See `/documentation/0.x-CHANGELOG.md` for previous changelogs.

### Breaking Changes:

- [AshJsonApi.Resource] relationship routes now depend on the action taking an argument with the same name as the relationship. See the upgrade for more.

- [AshJsonApi.ToJsonApiError] Introduced `AshJsonApi.ToJsonApiError` to convert errors to JSON API errors. This brings it more in line with other Ash extensions.

### Improvements:

- [AshJsonApi.Resource] create/update/destroy actions now use bulk operations
- [AshJsonApi.Router] router is now a dynamic hand-written router. This prevents compile time dependencies.
- [AshJsonApi.Error] honor path when building source pointers
